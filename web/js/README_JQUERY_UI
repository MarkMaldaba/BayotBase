When updating jQuery UI, create a build with the following components:

    * UI Core
        * All
    * Interactions
        * draggable
        * droppable
        * resizable
        * sortable
    * Widgets
        * tabs
        * datepicker

Theme: 'Smoothness' (simple gray colors should go with anything)
